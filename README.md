# OIT-challenge-v2

I used MinGW as a software to allow me to compile the main.cpp file in the windows terminal. Here is the guide I used to set it up: https://www.scaler.com/topics/c/c-compiler-for-windows/#setting-up-path-variable

I am now spending an additional hour on the project to reach 4 hours.

I am focusing on making improvements to the computer's decision making when playing against the Player.
I spent a lot of time exploring organizing the functions into other .cpp and .h files, but I ultimately decided against separating the functions.

If I had additional time, I would add a two player mode, and a harder CPU difficulty. It would aim to take the center position first, then it would aim to create a cat's game if the player doesn't throw away a win.

Thank you for the opportunity!
